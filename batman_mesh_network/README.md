# Smartnet Wireless Mesh Network

## Overview
Smartnet wireless mesh is a cost effective solution for connecting geospatially disparate devices across a facility or campus, where local wired copper or fibre network infrastructure is unavailable.

Smartnet wireless mesh is an ad hoc wireless mesh topology. The topology is scalable and allows for additional nodes to be added easily and cost effectively. The more nodes, the higher the throughout and reliability. There is no need for intensive antennae calibration required in other topologies. The solution uses the open source [B.A.T.M.A.N. Advanced](https://www.open-mesh.org/projects/batman-adv/wiki) layer 2 mesh routing protocol, running on routers using [OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org/) firmware. The solution uses conventional [802.11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11) wireless radio (eg 2.4GHz and 5GHz), so hardware is readily accessible.
