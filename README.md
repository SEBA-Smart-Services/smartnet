## SmartNet

SmartNet (formerly Ulysses) is an IPsec VPN network for connecting registered Schnedier Electric systems to local Schneider Electric service teams and Performance Centres.

The network is arranged in a site-to-site [hub-and-spoke topology](http://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=606584&seqNum=3), with each local Performance Centre as local "hub".

## Client VPN configuration

 * [Linux](linux-ipsec-client.md)
 * Non-Linux: For now, get started using the [Meraki Client VPN OS Configuration document](https://documentation.meraki.com/MX-Z/Client_VPN/Client_VPN_OS_Configuration). Better docs added as a TODO.

## TODO:

* Documentation for remote access client for:
  - Windows
  - iOS
  - Android 
* Documentation for deploying a new node.
* Meraki Dashboard API integration with Medusa.
